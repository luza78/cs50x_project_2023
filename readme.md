### Picking my project:

For my final project I wanted to create something that made life 
easier. The reason I  created this project is because nn my job as a 
ballet dancer  we receive a daily and weekly schedule, as well as 
castings, yearly schedules and other documents.
This is all sent out willy-nilly by email, and I thought it could make 
everyone's life simpler if we had it all in a centralized hub.

## Acknowledgement:

the outstanding team behind it, and how grateful I am to have been able to 
participate. I cannot wait to continue this journey.
Truly THANK YOU
