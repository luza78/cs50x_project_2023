#### Description:
````````````````````````````
$ 'Intranet' is a Python web application using the Flask framework.
$ The goal og this project was to create an application that hosts, receives and distributes information to employees.
$ The project uses sqlite3 to handle the database consisting of 3 tables that keeps track of users, file uploads, and even stores files by $ converting them to binary before storing them in our database as a BLOB

## Key Features:

* Admin and standard user types
* Admin users have access to an admin only control panel allows:
 
 - To view add, delete or modify existing users
 - Upload a schedule or a casting to the site

* To access the webapp your email must first be added by an admin to be able to register
* Users have access to view and download files from the site
* Uses a sqlite3 db containing 3 tables to keep track of users, casting, and keeping track of the schedule.

## Picking my project:
````````````````````````````

$ For my final project I wanted to create something that made life easier.
$ The reason I  created this project is because at my day job as a professional
$ ballet dancer, Things tend to be a little backwards, and somewhat antiquated.
$ We receive our daily and weekly schedules on a posting board, as well as 
$ castings, yearly schedules and other documents.

$ I thought to myself we can improve this, and hopefully by doing so
$ make myself, my colleagues', and my superiors' life a little better if we had it all in a centralized hub.
